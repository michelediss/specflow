# Specflow Architect Skill

Hosts templates and guidance for architect-mode work.

## Folders

- `assets/templates`: sources consumed by `npm --prefix specflow run specflow:init`.
- `assets/examples`: quick reference snippets.

Update the templates whenever the JSON structures evolve. Avoid storing source code here.
